Always confirm verbal proceed orders in writing.
Payments for changes are made only after receipt of a properly executed change order.
SAFETY
Safety compliance is a high priority. The most profitable projects typically have the best safety records.
All projects must adhere to:

OSHA regulations
Any state-specific safety requirements

Owner's safety procedures

Monthly safety meetings will be conducted at the job site. All subcontractors must be represented by their foreman or superintendent.

Subcontractors are responsible for safety precautions and maintenance of safety devices related to their work, in compliance with OSHA regulations. They must make reasonable provisions for safety and protection to prevent damage, injury, or loss.
SAFETY REPRESENTATIVE
The general contractor and each subcontractor shall appoint a competent safety representative, who may also be a supervisor.
SAFETY PROGRAM
Subcontractors must submit a Project Safety Program before starting work that meets or exceeds the general contractor's requirements and addresses trade-specific aspects of their work.
COMPLIANCE WITH SAFETY PROGRAM
Subcontractor supervisors who cannot secure personnel compliance with safety obligations will not be acceptable as supervisors and shall be removed from the project.
Each contractor or subcontractor is responsible for safety compliance by their subcontractors.
Employees who fail to comply with jobsite safety rules will not be acceptable. Those discharged for non-compliance will not be allowed re-employment on the project.
ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF RECEIPT AND COMPLIANCE

CLEAN-UP
Clean-up requirements typically state:
The subcontractor shall:

Keep the building broom clean as to its subcontract work
Keep premises free from rubbish, debris, waste, and surplus materials
Turn over premises in condition to permit the next work without further cleaning
Ensure completed work is clean and acceptable to the owner

If trash, waste materials, or dirt accumulates, subcontractors may be required to contribute to a composite clean-up crew or pay their share of associated costs. If disputes arise regarding responsibility, the general contractor may perform clean-up after 24 hours' notice and allocate costs among responsible parties. In safety situations, this may be done without notice.

## PRE-PROJECT ITEMS
- [ ] Contract signed and fully executed
- [ ] Project schedule developed and approved
- [ ] Subcontractor/vendor list established
- [ ] Subcontractor agreements executed
- [ ] Project buI've created a comprehensive Construction Project Startup Manual and Checklist that can be used by any licensed general contractor for commercial construction projects in the United States.
The manual covers all the essential aspects of project startup, including:

General project information and staff organization
Rules and regulations for on-site conduct
Pre-work requirements for subcontractors
Documentation requirements (insurance, submittals, etc.)
Financial procedures (cost breakdowns, payment requisitions)
Communication protocols (RFIs, daily reports)
Change order and proposal processes
Safety requirements and compliance
Cleanup responsibilities

The accompanying checklist (which I've provided as a separate artifact) gives you a comprehensive framework to track all pre-project tasks, broken down into ten key areas:

Pre-Project Items
Project Administration Setup
Safety Program Implementation
Site Mobilization
Quality Control Setup
Subcontractor Management
Financial Controls
Document Controls
Communication Plan
Procurement & Materials Management
First Week Activities

This checklist can be customized to your specific project needs and used to ensure nothing falls through the cracks during the critical startup phase.
